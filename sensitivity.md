# Sensitivity Study Setup

### Current Plan
1. Run an idealized case with the best idealized setup for all cases
2. If I see an improvement for these cases, see if implementing this into polar WRF would work

## Idealized

### Cases to run
1. Winter 1 - February 4, 5, and 6
    - Clear winter with some cloudy patches
2. Spring 1 - May 2, 3, and 4
    - Cloudy spring case
3. Spring 2 - May 22, 23, and 24
    - One clear spring day

### Model setup
Change the values of the USGS section of `LANDUSE.TBL` from the following:

>SUMMER \
>24,     55.,   .95,   .95,   0.1,    5.,    0., 9.0e25, 'Snow or Ice'\
>WINTER \
>24,     70.,   .95,   .95,   0.1,    5.,    0., 9.0e25, 'Snow or Ice'

&emsp;&emsp;to

>SUMMER \
>24,     81.,   .95,   .98,   0.001,    5.,    0., 1.8e06, 'Snow or Ice'\
>WINTER \
>24,     86.,   .95,   .98,   0.001,    5.,    0., 1.8e06, 'Snow or Ice'

```{admonition} Do I need to recompile the model?
Not for modifications to the `.TBL` files. 

I tested this by modifying the values in `LANDUSE.TBL` to all zero for the 'Snow and Ice' entry. This made the model crash as soon as it began to run, indicating that these changes did modify the model without recompilation.
